# Microsoft Fabric Code Snippets

This directory contains reusable code snippets for common Microsoft Fabric tasks and operations.

## What are Snippets?

Snippets are small, focused pieces of code that solve specific problems. They are designed to be:

- **Focused**: Each snippet does one thing well
- **Reusable**: Easy to copy and adapt to your needs
- **Well-documented**: Clear comments and usage examples
- **Tested**: Validated in Microsoft Fabric environments

## Categories

Snippets are organized by category:

- **PySpark**: Data transformation and processing with PySpark
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebook utilities and helpers
- **Data Ingestion**: Loading data from various sources
- **Data Export**: Exporting data to different formats
- **APIs**: Interacting with Fabric REST APIs
- **Security**: Authentication and authorization examples
- **Performance**: Optimization techniques and best practices

## How to Use Snippets

1. Browse the category folders to find relevant snippets
2. Read the comments in each snippet file
3. Copy the code into your Fabric notebook or script
4. Modify parameters and configurations as needed
5. Test in your environment

## Snippet Format

Each snippet includes:

- Clear description of what it does
- Prerequisites or dependencies
- Input/output parameters
- Usage example
- Error handling where applicable
